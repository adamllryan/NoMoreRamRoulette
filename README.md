old thing i made with java you need java 8 installed for it to run. i forget which optifine installer is the real one but i've just been changing the names as new versions come out have fun




ok so i got lazy i am throwing in some garbage in my programming folder that i started and didnt finish(aka didn't even start) so those are there too i guess
